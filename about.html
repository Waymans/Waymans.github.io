              I graduated from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, with a bachelors in mathematics. Studying there pushed me towards technologies like TeX and RStudio. I enjoyed working with those and later transitioned into HTML and CSS, making webpages. I used JavaScript to write algorithms and solve challenges. Shortly after I was making webpages with React and jQuery, and Data Driven Documents(D3) to visualize data. I've since worked on the back end with Node and MongoDB, etc, putting together full stack web applications.

              I enjoy creating new things and also challenge myself with interesting projects. I work mostly with JavaScript and its related libraries. I enjoy making functional and responsive websites and working on server-side solutions. I plan to increase my current skills by challenging myself with more full stack projects and having fun doing so. Feel free to contact me if you have any thoughts or questions.
