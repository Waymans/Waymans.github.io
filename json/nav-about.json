      "&emsp; I'm a programmer who loves to create new things and also challenge myself with interesting projects. I work mostly with JavaScript, but I am eager to learn much more! Although I haven't been doing this for very long I want to continue learning and creating better things. I plan to increase my current skills by challenging myself with more full stack projects while working on algorithms and data structures.", 
      "&emsp; I started working with HTML and CSS, without any prior knowledge, to make web pages. Soon I was using JavaScript to write algorithms and solve challenges. Shortly after that I was making my webpages come to life with the help of React and jQuery, even Data Driven Documents(D3) to visualize data. A few months later I came to the back end, and although unfamiliar at first, I was able to adapt and put together full stack web applications in a short period of time using Node, MongoDB and front end libraries.", 
      "&emsp; I'm a good listener and a quick learner. I always try to perfom the best work I can do and be a competant individual that people can count on. I also have a background in math which initially pushed me towards technologies like TeX and RStudio. (See some of these below.) These studies made me more disciplined in analytical and logical work. They gave me a stronger attention to detail and a sharper mind when facing problems. I believe I can be a malleable asset to any team. Feel free to contact me if you have any thoughts or questions. I hope you like what you see!"
